# Alonso Hernandez Tavera: My Web Portfolio

My name is Alonso, welcome to my portfolio. I am a Systems and Computer Engineer from Universidad de los Andes in Colombia, with a Minor in Japanese Language and Culture, and a strong focus on both cloud-deployed web application development and social robotics. I consider discipline to be one of my most outstanding qualities, as it is the pillar of my everyday behavior. Learning is one of my greatest passions in life, and I describe myself as a lifelong learner. I am a physically active person; I dedicate time every day to exercise and, on occasion, get together with friends or colleagues to play volleyball or golf. I enjoy staying up to date with world news, watching videos related to geography and geopolitics, reading motivational books, and learning Japanese through news.
